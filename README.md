# Campus-Recruitment-Prediction
This project aims to predict campus placement outcomes for students based on various academic and personal parameters using machine learning techniques. The predictive system leverages algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest to analyze features such as SSC percentage, HSC percentage, degree type, work experience, and more, providing valuable insights to enhance placement performance for educational institutions.

Features:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses statistical and visualization techniques to identify patterns and trends in placement data.
3. Feature Engineering: Transforms and creates features to improve model accuracy and predictive power.
4. Machine Learning Models:

  Linear Regression: Serves as a baseline for performance comparison.
  
  Random Forest: Acts as the primary predictive model, capturing non-linear relationships effectively.
  
5. Evaluation Metrics: Includes MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² for comprehensive model assessment.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
7. Web Application: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for real-time placement predictions based on user inputs.

Future Scope:

1. Enhanced predictive accuracy through advanced feature engineering and algorithm optimization.
2. Real-time deployment during placement drives for immediate decision-making.
3. Integration of soft skills evaluation for a more holistic analysis of employability.
4. Industry-specific prediction models tailored to sector-specific requirements.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in transforming campus placement processes by improving prediction accuracy and decision-making. By leveraging Random Forest and other techniques, institutions can gain actionable insights to maximize student placement success rates.
